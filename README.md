# Task 10: KNN – Handwritten Digit Classification

## Dataset
- Sklearn Digits Dataset (load_digits)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored digit dataset
2. Visualized handwritten digits
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Applied StandardScaler for feature normalization
5. Trained KNN classifier with K=3
6. Tuned K values (3,5,7,9)
7. Plotted Accuracy vs K graph
8. Generated confusion matrix
9. Displayed predictions on test images

## Result
- Best accuracy achieved = 96.9%
- KNN performed well for handwritten digit recognition

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates distance-based classification and the importance of feature scaling in KNN.
